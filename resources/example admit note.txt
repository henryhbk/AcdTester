   Assessment and Plan
   A/Pt: 24 y.o F with SLE, ESRD on HD and malignant HTN presenting with
   abd pain, diarrhea, and HTN.
   .
   # Hypertension: The patient has a well-documented history of paroxysmal
   hypertension related to pain, anxiety, narcotic withdrawal and
   occassional poor medication and HD compliance. She reports taking all
   of her medications.  Suspect contribution from acute abdominal pain and
   GI distress.  Hx of presenting with BP up to 260/160 but most often
   without evidence of end-organ ischemia, such as today.
   - DC labetalol gtt
   - Start nicardipine drip, goal SBP 180-200 today.
   - Will continue home BP regimen of clonidine, labetalol, aliskiren,
   nifedipine, and hydralazine
   - Control pain per protocol with dilaudid 2mg po q 4HR PRN, hold on IV
   pain medications unless pt unable to tolerate po
   - HD per renal recs
   .
   # abdominal pain/diarrhea: clinically consistent with gastroenteritis.
   Recent antibiotics and multiple hospital stays concerning for cdiff
   colitis, though viral gastroenteritis is also possible.  Medication
   effect also possible.  Lastly, she has a history of thrombogenesis, so
   ischemic colitis is possible though her lactate is normal.  KUB showing
   fullness c/w with ascites, no known history of liver disease, though
   she has had chronic elevated LFTs. Chronic elevated AP, GGT sent in ED.
   - stool studies
   - LFTs
   - abd u/s for ascites
   - f/u GGT
   - symptomatic care with PO dilaudid
   .
   # SLE: continue prednisone at 4 mg PO daily
   .
   # ESRD: Renal following, continue dialysis per renal recs.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: patient on lifetime anticoagulation for hx of multiple
   thrombotic events, INR subtherapuetic.
   - continue coumadin
   - heparin bridge until therapeutic
   .
   # HOCM: evidence of myocardial hypertrophy on Echo. Currently not
   symptomatic.
   -Continue labetalol
   .
   # Pain management:
   - 2mg PO q 4hrs
   .
   # FEN/GI - regular diet, monitor lytes
   .
   # Access - HD catheter, PIV
