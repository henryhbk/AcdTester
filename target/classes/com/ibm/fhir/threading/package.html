  Provides threads to perform many of the enhancement operations using multiple threads as the data is quite large. For instance to add fhir json to each of the labs was 27m fhir conversions along with 27m database writes. So doing it across 8 cores made a huge difference in the completion time.
  I would use these mostly as templates to base your won threads off of.
