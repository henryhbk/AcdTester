	Provides all the hibernate DAO classes. These are all thread safe. And
	can be instantiated either dynamically or statically. They all obey a
	service interface which can be used for things like a RESTful service
	or a something to have a consistent API.
	<br>
	<h2>ABout the DAOs</h2>
	The DAO classes all live in _com.ibm.nlp.hibernate_ inside the project.
	Some of them only handle one entity (like say <b>SocialHistoryDao</b> while
	others like <b>BillingDao</b>b>, handle several entities (as MIMIC contains many
	different billing code tables, such as DRGs, ICD, CPT, etc). Again you
	should instantiate them by their service interface, however sometimes
	you just want a local method in the DAO that nobody else would ever
	want exposed, or internal to the DAO, in which case you don't add it to
	the service interface and instantiate it in your class directly (please
	note the documentation style for DAO classes is linked javadoc to the
	interface's javadoc, which obviously won't work on a method not in the
	service.
